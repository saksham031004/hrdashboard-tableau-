🧑‍💼 HR Analytics and Insights Dashboard
🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Tableau HR Dashboard, indicated as being related to training content (Chandoo), is a dynamic and interactive data visualization project designed for Human Resources managers, analysts, and business leaders. It provides a comprehensive, single-view analysis of key HR metrics and employee data, allowing users to monitor workforce health, identify attrition risks, track talent acquisition, and assess departmental efficiency. The core purpose is to transform complex employee and operational data into actionable insights for strategic workforce planning and decision-making.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

📊 Tableau Desktop – The primary platform used for data blending, creating calculated fields, and designing the interactive dashboards and sheets.

🧠 Tableau Calculated Fields / LOD Expressions – Employed for creating advanced HR-specific metrics such as Attrition Rate, Employee Tenure, and Performance Distribution.

📂 Tableau Hyper – The project utilizes a Tableau Hyper data extract for efficient, high-performance querying and analysis of the underlying HR data.
The data source is stored internally within the workbook: Data/TableauTemp/#TableauTemp_0rjarns1gc7mhd1cykpoe17d3x7l.hyper.

📁 File Format – Developed as a Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx), which bundles the dashboard, worksheets, and the hyper data extract, making it ready to share and view.

📊 Data Source
The project utilizes a practice dataset focused on standard Human Resources data, commonly used for HR analytics tutorials.

Source: Hypothetical/Practice HR Data (likely a single flat file or simple relational model).

Data Content: The dataset is expected to contain employee-level records essential for HR metrics, such as:

Headcount Metrics: Total Employees (Active, Terminated), Department/Business Unit.

Demographics: Employee Age, Gender, and Length of Service.

Compensation: Salary/Compensation details.

Recruitment/Turnover: Hire Date, Termination Date, and Reason for leaving (for Attrition analysis).

Performance: Performance Ratings or related metrics.

✨ Features / Highlights
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide clear, actionable insights into workforce operations.

Business Problem: HR data is often scattered across different systems, making it difficult for leaders to proactively identify talent risks, understand the drivers of employee turnover, and measure the effectiveness of HR programs.

Goal of the Dashboard: To create an intuitive, filterable interface that unifies core HR metrics, simplifies the tracking of trends over time, and allows users to drill down into specific departments or demographics to diagnose issues.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displays the current Headcount, Attrition Rate, and Average Employee Tenure at the top of the dashboard.

Headcount Trend: A line chart showing the change in headcount over the past few months or years, often broken down by employment status (Active/Terminated).

Attrition Analysis: A breakdown (e.g., bar chart) of the Attrition Rate by Department or Manager, highlighting high-risk areas.

Workforce Demographics: Visualizations (e.g., histograms or tree maps) showing the distribution of employees by age band or length of service.

Salary Distribution: A box-and-whisker plot or bar chart to compare the average Salary by Department against the company average.
